# IsItABusinessDay
a check for whether a day(today) is a business day in Norway

It should be able to take any day as input as of now.
If there are specific weekdays that are off each week, you can add those to an arraylist (type DaysOfWeek) to send in with the method call. (ie Sunday is off each week, one can add DayOfWeek.SUNDAY to the arrayList)
If there are no days, send in an empty Collections list

Time period off in a year:
Decided to not add any functionality for this as that can be handled on one's own side instead.

TODO:
Make Tests for a random year
